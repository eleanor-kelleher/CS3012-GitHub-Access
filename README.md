# CS3012-GitHub-Access 
In this repository, I have interrogated the GitHub API to retrieve and display data for CS3012.

My goal was to compare three repositories owned by users against three repositories owned by organisations, and compare the commits by users to those repositories and see if there are many differences between the two approaches. I chose three users and three organisations at random, but made sure they were of a comparable size in terms of commits.

These were the three user-owned repositories I picked and how their data was displayed:

### User-Owned Repository Results
As can be seen (and expected), the user who owns the repository has added the majority of commits to that repository, in these three average cases they make up between two thirds and three quarters of the total commits. Just by looking at these doughnut charts, it is quite easy to see who owns the repository in question.

These were the three organisation-owned repositories I picked and how their data was displayed:

### Organisation-Owned Repository Results
In an organisation, the ownership of each repository is much more spread out. There are a few top users who contribute a considerable percentage of the commits but the difference can clearly be seen.

### Conclusions
This data could be useful for seeing which users are the 'busiest' in a repository, and which are not contributing as much as they should. Visualising the data in a clear and coherent way can help with understanding.
